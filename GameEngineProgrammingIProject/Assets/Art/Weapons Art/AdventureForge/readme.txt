* SPELLCRAFT LITE v1.0.0												  *
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything in the package was created at GameMechanix.
Feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter.

How to use - Demo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under "SpellCraft Assets" find the folder named "Demo". Here you will find a "SpellCraft Effects Demo" scene file that you can load up to play the Demo.

SpellCraft Effects Demo - This displays each spell FX. Click anywhere on the ground to spawn a spell. Use the arrow keys to change the current spell.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spells
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All spell prefabs can be found under the "Spells" folder.

Spell Prefabs specifically used for the demo scenes can be found under the "Demo" folder in the "Prefabs" and "UI Prefabs" folders.

"Effects" folder contains spell prefabs for the effects mode. You'll find each spell under it's own folder name.

"FX" folder contains spell prefabs purely for FX. They contain little or no functionality. It's merely for looks!

You can drag and drop the prefabs from any of the 2 above folders to see how they work.

*** The spells are all built off of separate component scripts that share similar functionality.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scripts for the spells that are used in the demo can be found in the "Scripts" folder.

The scripts were made so that they could be shared across similar spells.

You should be able to decipher what each script is doing and how you can combine them to create these effects.

Contact me if you are still unsure of how it works!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other Assets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other assets such as materials, textures and models can be found in the "Source" folder.
