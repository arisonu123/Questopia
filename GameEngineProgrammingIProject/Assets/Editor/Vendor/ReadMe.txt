Info:
The script creates a 6-sided skybox with the data from Google Street View and stores the images and the finished skybox to disk.
This is an Editor-Script make sure, that it is in a Folder called Editor.
It can be found here: Unity Editor -> Window -> StreetView 2 Skybox

Usage:
Enter your API-Key (if you have one), some coordinates and maybe another name.
Hit Create Skybox.
The script will then start to download the images and assemble them into a skybox.

To get the coordinates, open google maps and enable the Street View-Mode. Drag n' Drop the little yellow guy to a location.
The URL changes and the interesting part is after the @ symbol. The next two numbers (comma-separated) are the latitude and then the longitude.

For example:
Link = https://www.google.com/maps/@59.2571819,8.4080728,3a,75y,328.38h,96.73t/data=!3...(and some more stuff)
Latitude  = 59.2571819
Longitude = 8.4080728
